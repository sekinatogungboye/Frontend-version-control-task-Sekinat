# Frontend-version-control-task-Sekinat
Understanding version control
This repository was created as part of my version control deliverable. The goal was to demonstrate an understanding of Git and GitHub workflows, collaboration practices, and version control commands.
The repo contains a simple HTML/CSS project with multiple branches to simulate a real-world collaboration workflow.

Branches-Purpose
main: Final working version of the project.
feature-header: Implemented a styled header section (inline-styled <h1>).
footer-section: Implemented and styled a footer section.

Workflow-Steps Completed
Initialized a local Git repository and linked it to GitHub.
Created feature branches (feature-header, footer-section).
Made multiple meaningful commits on each branch with clear messages.
Opened Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub and simulated review comments.
Merged PRs into the main branch after review.
Renamed a branch and fetched updates locally.
